**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?
I initially expected this course that it would combine the lessons we learned in our previous subjects, OPSYST1 and SERADM1, which it did. I also anticipated a mix of hands-on activities and lectures focused on system administration. While the course aligned with these expectations, I feel it fell somewhat short because not all topics were fully covered. This may have been due to class suspensions, which made the course feel a bit incomplete.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?



Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

One of the most effective strategies I did during my learning process was to engage in consistent practice and thorough review of every detail related to the course activities. I was able to strengthen my understanding and remember the key concepts by dedicating time to revisit the lessons regularly. This approach not only helped me remember details but also enabled me to apply what I learned effectively in various lab activities. Additionally, I found that breaking down complex topics into manageable parts and discussing them with other people further enhanced my comprehension, making it easier to recall information when needed. 

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

I gained valuable hands-on experience and practical skills, which have contributed to my confidence and ability to perform tasks related to server administration. This includes lab exercises, specifically only the basic ones, such as learning some basic Linux commands, connecting two clients in a DHCP server, and using basic GitHub commands. Through the course material and lab exercises, I was able to improve my technical knowledge and feel more confident applying it to real-world scenarios if I choose to pursue a role as a system dministrator .


How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

In terms of future studies, this course has encouraged me to continue developing my technical skills and knowledge, and to pursue related courses in systems administration, networking, and virtualization. The information
and skills learned in this course will be essential for me to perform tasks in systems administration effectively, and will also help me to advance in my career. In the future, I plan to use the skills and knowledge gained from this program to pursue a career in the IT industry, specifically in server administration. This could include system administrator, network administrator, or data center technician. I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned and developed these skills, and I will apply them in my future studies, career, and personal life.
