**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?
I initially expected this course that it would combine the lessons we learned in our previous subjects, OPSYST1 and SERADM1, which it did. I also anticipated a mix of hands-on activities and lectures focused on system administration. While the course aligned with these expectations, I feel it fell somewhat short because not all topics were fully covered. This may have been due to class suspensions, which made the course feel a bit incomplete.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?



Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?
The most effective strategy is to keep practicing and review every single details about the activities, with that I am able to remember every detail and apply it in every lab activities.

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?
