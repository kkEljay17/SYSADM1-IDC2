# SYSADM1 -- Git Basics

Answer the following research questions about Git, GitLab desktop and
GitHub.

1.  What is Git, and why is it important in software development?

-   Git is a version control system that tracks modifications made to
    files, providing a comprehensive record of all changes. It is
    important since its functionality enables users to revert to
    specific versions of files when necessary. Furthermore, Git
    facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple people to make
    changes, which can be merged into one source. 

2.  How does Git track changes in a project?

-   Git tracks changes in a project by using a system of snapshots and
    stages. For instance, When you want to save specific changes, you
    use the command git add. This command tells Git which files to track
    and prepares them for saving. The files are moved to the staging
    area, meaning they are ready to be included in the next snapshot.

3.  What is the difference between a local repository and a remote
    repository in Git?

-   The local repository is the version of your project stored on your
    own computer and you can make changes, save them, and manage files
    without needing the internet. On the other hand, remote repository
    is the version of your project stored online (like on GitHub or
    GitLab)and also lets multiple people work together by sharing their
    changes and getting updates from each other.

4.  What are the basic Git commands?

> ***git init:*** Starts a new local repository.
>
> ***git clone** **\<repository\>:*** Copies an existing repository to
> your computer.
>
> ***git add \<filename\>:*** Prepares changes to be saved.
>
> ***git commit -m \"\<message*\>\":** Saves the changes with a message
> explaining what you did.
>
> ***git status:*** Shows the current state of your files and what's
> ready to be saved.
>
> ***git push \<remote\> \<branch\>:*** Sends your changes to the online
> repository.
>
> ***git pull \<remote\> \<branch\>:*** Gets updates from the online
> repository.

5.  How do you check the status of a Git repository?

-   git status

6.  What is the purpose of branches in Git, and how do you create and
    switch between them?

-   Branches let you work on different features or fixes separately
    without messing up the main project.

> To create branches:

-   \$ git branch testing \<- testing is the branch name

> This creates a new pointer to the same commit you're currently on
>
> To switch between them:

\$ git checkout testing

> This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.

7.  What are GitLab Desktop and GitHub, and how are they different from
    Git?

-   GitHub is a website for storing and sharing code using Git. It has
    features like pull requests and issue tracking while GitLab is
    similar to GitHub but includes tools for automated testing and
    deployment and also you can host it on your own server. Git is the
    underlying system that tracks changes in code. Both GitHub and
    GitLab use Git but add extra features for collaboration.

8.  How do you connect a local Git repository to a GitLab or GitHub
    repository?

-   git remote add origin \<repository-url\>

9.  What are the steps to collaborate with others using GitLab or
    GitHub?

-   To clone a repository, use the command git clone
    \<repository-url\> to create a copy on your computer. After cloning,
    you can create a new branch by using git checkout -b
    \<branch-name\> to start working on it. Make any necessary changes
    to the files, and then stage those changes with git add
    \<filename\> to prepare them for saving. Once staged, save your
    changes with a commit by using git commit -m \"\<message\>\", which
    allows you to add a note about what you changed. To send your branch
    to the online repository, use git push origin \<branch-name\>.
    Finally, visit the website to create a pull request (PR) so that
    others can review your changes.

10. How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?

-   To resolve merge conflicts, start by attempting to merge branches
    using the command git merge \<branch-name\>. If conflicts arise,
    open the affected files and manually resolve the issues. Once you
    have fixed the conflicts, stage the changes with git add
    \<filename\>. Finally, complete the merge by committing your changes
    with git commit.

11. What is a pull request, and why is it used in GitHub?

-   A **pull request (PR)** is a way for someone to ask for their
    changes to be added to another branch (usually the main one). It
    allows team members to review and discuss the changes before they
    are merged. It is used in GitHub cause provides a platform for
    discussion among developers. Team members can comment on the
    changes, ask questions, and suggest improvements, fostering
    collaboration and knowledge sharing.

12. What are some best practices for writing commit messages?

-   When writing commit messages, aim for conciseness by being brief yet
    descriptive. Concentrate on the importance of the change rather than
    the technical details of how it was implemented. Ensure clarity by
    avoiding vague language; instead, be specific about what changes
    were made and why they are necessary. Lastly, maintain consistency
    by adhering to a standard format, which makes the messages easier to
    read and understand.
